FURRIES: Frickin UnReadable Ridiculous language Including Erroneous Syntax<br/>
Use the `compile` script to compile and link a program.<br/>
To build, zig 0.14.* must be installed.<br/>

Grammar:<br/>
    All statements are in the form 
    `[variable] [function] [up to 5 input values];`<br/>
    This can be though of as 
    `[variable] = [function]([up to 5 input values]);`
    in a more C-style language.
    Syntax example (simple hello world)

    ``
   
     // include standard library header
     #include "std.uwu"
     // strings are created using the "data" function, and do not use quotes
     hello_world data Hello, world!\n;
     
     // function definitions use the same syntax of everything else
     // so the space and newline are required
     main ();
         // dollar sign ($) is used as the address-of operator, and also prefixes all integers.
         // _ in the first position means to ingore the output, and is also used if
         // the function does not have an output (such as print)
         _ print $hello_world;
     // "end" ends the function and returns.
     _ end;
